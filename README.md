## WyoBio Mobile
### Citizen Science = Science for Everyone!

WyoBio: Contribute your animal, bird, plant, insect and fungi observations! The Wyoming Biodiversity Citizen Science Initiative (WyoBio) is a project intended to connect all citizens and visitors in Wyoming USA with information about biodiversity - contribute your species observations while you are on a hike, or from your backyard. Snap a photo, select a species from the list, and submit your information. This mobile app is part of a broader project and map application. Visit our [website](http://wyobio.org) for additional information.

The source code for WyoBio Mobile is based on [Species Tracker](http://species.wq.io/), a concept for a mobile app for biodiversity monitoring created during the [Hackfest](http://scistarter.com/blog/2015/02/reports-hackfest-citizen-science-association-conference/) at the inaugural [Citizen Science 2015 conference](http://citizenscienceassociation.org/conference/).  WyoBio Mobile is powered by [wq, a modular open-source framework](http://wq.io/) for citizen science, crowdsourcing, and VGI.

The primary changes we made to update Species Tracker to WyoBio Mobile include:
 * Integration with WyoBio's [existing ArcGIS application](http://wyobio.org/application/) and Windows server
 * Integration with WyoBio's existing authentication infrastructure
 * Custom theme and icons
