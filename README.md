### A mobile app for field-based Citizen Science

This is the source code for [**Species Tracker**](http://species.wq.io/), a concept for a mobile app for biodiversity monitoring.  During the [Hackfest](http://scistarter.com/blog/2015/02/reports-hackfest-citizen-science-association-conference/) at the inaugural [Citizen Science 2015 conference](http://citizenscienceassociation.org/conference/), we used the [wq framework](http://wq.io/) to create a simple prototype that allows anyone to upload photos and GPS coordinates together with species information.

Below is a description of the steps we went through at the Hackfest:

1. **Define project goals**.  What kind of observations do we want volunteers to submit?  What metadata do we need?  Are there any existing datasets we could use?  (Bring your ideas and design concepts!)
2. **Implement rough prototype**.  We'll rely on the [project scaffolding tools](https://wq.io/docs/setup) provided by the [wq framework](https://wq.io/) to get an app up and running quickly.  (Experience with GitHub, HTML, Python and/or Ubuntu will be useful but not required.)
3.  **Test and refine**.  Try submitting some photos from your device.  How can we improve the user experience? (Bring your mobile and tablet devices!)
